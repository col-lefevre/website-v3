# Website v3

This is the 3rd iteration of my personal site. Resources are as follows:

-   [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) for templating and static site building
-   [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) for reusable UI components
-   [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/) for SVG icons
-   [OpenSans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans) for fonts
-   [JQuery](https://jquery.com/) for less painful JavaScript
-   [PicoCSS](https://picocss.com/) for UI inspiration and color scheme
-   [Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/home) for project image generation
