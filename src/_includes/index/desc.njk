    <p>I am a Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) researcher at  <a href="https://prohealth.luddy.indiana.edu/">Proactive Health Informatics</a>. I recently graduated from Indiana University Bloomington with a B.S. in Informatics.  </p>
    <p>My research focuses on designing technologies which navigate cultural, social and personal factors to support health and wellbeing. At present, I am particularly interested in digital mental health and self-management.</p>
    <p>I am currently advised by <a href="http://cfchung.com">Dr. Christina Chung</a>, and am a prospective applicant for HCI-focused Ph.D. programs which begin Fall 2024.</p>
